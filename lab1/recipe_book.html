        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> “Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong> Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong> Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong> Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 11:</strong> Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 12:</strong> Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 13:</strong> Add any garnish of your preference.<br><br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 4 inches wide.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, turning once, until browned on both sides and no longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes total. Remove from grill.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Heat the barbecue to medium hot (there will be white ash over the red hot coals – about 40 mins after lighting). Lightly brush one side of each burger with vegetable oil.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong> Place the burgers, oil-side down, on the barbecue. Cook for 5 mins until the meat is lightly charred. Don’t move them around or they may stick.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong> Oil the other side, then turn over using tongs. Don’t press down on the meat, as that will squeeze out the juices.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong> Cook for 5 mins more for medium. If you like your burgers pink in the middle, cook 1 min less each side. For well done, cook 1 min more.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 9:</strong> Take the burgers off the barbecue. Leave to rest on a plate so that all the juices can settle inside.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 10:</strong> Slice four burger buns in half. Place, cut-side down, on the barbecue rack and toast for 1 min until they are lightly charred. Place a burger inside each bun, then top with your choice of accompaniment.<br><br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Cook 1lb/500g of dried spaghetti (or any other long dried pasta) in a large pot of salted boiling water per packet MINUS 1 minute.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, prepare one of the sauces below.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> When pasta is ready, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, and drain pasta.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add pasta into chosen sauce with 3/4 cup pasta cooking water. Toss pasta until sauce thickens and sticks to pasta (called "emulsifying" the sauce), 1 - 2 minutes. Use more pasta water if needed to loosen sauce.<br><br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong> Season with salt and pepper to taste. Finish pasta per chosen recipe.<br><br>
